  Hi!, I'm Navneet, <b>Masters Student(MSc)</b> in <b>Electrical Engineering</b> with specialization in <b>Robotics and Mechatronics</b>, at the <a href="http://www.utwente.nl/"><b>University of Twente</b></a>, Enschede, Netherlands. Currently I'm pursuing my master thesis project at the Scene Understanding Group, University of Twente and the ITC Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation, Enschede under the supervision of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-ying-yang-038ab0a6/">Dr. Michael Yang</a>, Assistant Professor at the UT. My thesis project is on improving neural radiance fields using transfer learning for efficient scene reconstruction. During the course of my graduate studies, I got an opportunity to worked as a <b>Computer Vision & Machine Learning Intern</b> at <strong><a href="https://www.lely.com/">Lely Technologies NV</a></strong>, Maassluis, Netherlands. I was part of the Vision Team at Lely, supervised by <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/yan-li-49a60253">Dr. Yan Li </a>(Expert Product Developer @Lely), where I worked on implementing generative adversarial learning techniques for synthesizing simulated scenes from semantic labels. I graduated from <strong><a href="http://www.vit.ac.in/" class="md-link">VIT University, Vellore</a></strong> with bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering (2017). Right after graduation, I joined <strong><a href="https://new.abb.com/products/robotics" class="md-link">ABB's Robotics Motion Division</a></strong> in Bangalore as a Graduate Engineer Trainee (April,2017-August,2017). At ABB, I was part of the design and simulation team, developing the initial prototype version of Anthropomorphic Robot Arm(ARA) for collaborative robot applications.</p>

I worked at the <strong><a href="http://www.rbccps.org/" class="md-link">Robert Bosch Center for Cyber Physical Systems (RBCCPS)</a></strong> at IISc, Bangalore as a Project Assistant (since August,2018), where my research focussed mainly on Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning for high precision manipulation and insertion tasks & also haptic teleoperation of industrial robots. Research advisor(s): <a href="https://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~shalabh/" class="md-link"> Dr. Shalabh Bhatnagar</a> (Dept. of Computer Science and Automation, IISc), <a href="http://www.cense.iisc.ac.in/bharadwaj-amrutur" class="md-link">Dr. Bharadwaj Amrutur</a> (Dept. of Electrical Communication Engineering & RBCCPS, IISc) & <a href="https://shishirny.github.io/" class="md-link">Dr. Shishir N Y Kolathaya</a> (RBCCPS, IISc).

Prior to joining RBCCPS, I worked at the <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/compintellab/home" class="md-link">Computational Intelligence Laboratory</a></strong> & <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/compintellab/home/uavla" class="md-link">Advanced Flight Simulation Laboratory</a></strong> at the Aerospace Engineering Division of <strong><a href="https://iisc.ac.in/" class="md-link">Indian Institute of Science(IISc)</a></strong>, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.aero.iisc.ernet.in/people/s-n-omkar/" class="md-link">Dr. S N Omkar</a> (Chief Research Scientist, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering, IISc) as a Project Assistant (August,2017-July,2018). My research primarily focused on developing simulation frameworks related to several robot learning algorithms for bipedal walking robot and autonomous navigation of UAVs in indoor environments. I had also worked on human motion dynamics & stability analysis using optical motion capture and musculoskeletal modelling softwares (like OpenSim & Adams LifeMod).</p>
